# Elliptic Curve Deep Dive

This repository implements elliptic curves, but introduces vocabulary intended to reflect the mathematical language used to describe elliptic curves.

So not only are the algorithms being used to "generate a public key" or to "derive a shared secret", but the elliptic curve group arithmetics—such as additions, identity elements, additive inverse—on the elliptic curve abelian group are defined as such, rather than having them be abstracted away to match the problem domain.

But really, all if this is just impractical, and was created merely as an exercise.
